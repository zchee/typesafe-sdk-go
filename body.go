// bodyMember is one member a call adds to the top level of its request
// body, as the Python SDK's extra_body does (internal/engine.BodyMember).
type bodyMember = engine.BodyMember

// memberState names the state member in an encode failure's message.
const memberState = engine.MemberState

// encodeBody encodes the request body of one System One call into a pooled
// scratch buffer. It returns the body holding the call's reference, which
// the caller drops with Release when the call returns; [requestReaders]
// gives the transport its own references.
//
// The body is the JSON object {"state":…,"model":…,"questions":…} followed
// by the members of extra, laid out as the Python SDK's {**body,
// **extra_body}: an extra member named "state", "model" or "questions"
// replaces that member's value where it stands, and the value it replaces is
// not encoded at all; any other name is appended in the order extra first
// names it. When extra names a member more than once, the last value is
// written.
//
// The state, and an extra "state" too, must be text, a JSON object or an
// array: sonic writes it (codec.EncodeState); a [RawJSON] state, or the
// RawJSON a non-nil *RawJSON points to, is written as it is after
// codec.AppendRawState's check; [Content] is written as a question writes
// it. model is written as a JSON string and qs's bytes as
// they are. Any other value may be any JSON value: sonic writes it
// (codec.EncodeValue), a RawJSON value as it is after codec.AppendRawValue's
// check, Content as a question writes it and unset Content as null.
//
// A float inside the state and the extra values that sonic writes keeps
// sonic's spelling (rulings R46 and R59), a consequence of section 6.1.2
// encoding them with sonic and of the owner's decision D1, not a choice of
// this function: 3.0 is written 3, -0.0 as 0 on arm64 and as -0 on amd64
// (K27: sonic's amd64 JIT writes the sign, its arm64 VM does not), and
// 1e16 <= |x| < 1e21 and 1e-6 <= |x| < 1e-5 in fixed digits, where the
// Python SDK writes 3.0, -0.0 and e-notation. The same state can therefore
// be sent with different bytes from the two architectures, for a negative
// zero only. A value that needs an exact spelling is sent as RawJSON,
// or carries the number as a string. In the state and the extra values, a
// map's members go out in Go's iteration order, which changes from one call
// to the next where Python keeps a dict's insertion order (rulings R55 and
// R59); the body of one call, and so every attempt of it, is encoded once. A
// struct or RawJSON gives stable bytes.
//
// The output of a caller's json.Marshaler, a nested json.RawMessage among
// them, is the caller's contract, as a top-level RawJSON is (ruling R61):
// sonic's check of it does not refuse every invalid output (K26), while the
// SDK's own nested Content and RawJSON go through wire's scanner (R60), and
// the body is not scanned again as a whole.
//
// It fails with a [*ConfigError] when qs is nil or holds no question (a
// Prepared that [Questions.Prepare] did not return), or when model is not
// valid UTF-8, and with an [*InvalidRequestError] when a member cannot be
// encoded. The configuration is checked first.
