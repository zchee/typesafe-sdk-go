// PreparedFor returns the question set that the struct type T declares: one
// question per answer field, in field order, prepared as [Questions.Prepare]
// prepares a set built by hand.
//
// An answer field is an exported field of type [NoulAnswer], [ChoiceAnswer]
// or [ScoreAnswer] whose struct tag has a "typesafe" key describing the
// question it answers:
//
//	type Ticket struct {
//		Billing typesafe.NoulAnswer   `typesafe:"kind=noul;instructions=Is this about billing, invoices or refunds?;yes=payments or invoices"`
//		Tone    typesafe.ChoiceAnswer `typesafe:"kind=choice;instructions=What is the tone?;options=calm=neutral or polite|angry"`
//		Urgency typesafe.ScoreAnswer  `typesafe:"kind=score;instructions=How urgent?;levels=can wait|this week|today"`
//		Spam    typesafe.NoulAnswer   `typesafe:"kind=noul;optional;instructions=Spam?"`
//	}
//
// PreparedFor[Ticket] asks the same four questions, with the same bytes on
// the wire, as
//
//	typesafe.NewQuestions().
//		Noul("Billing", typesafe.Noul{Instructions: typesafe.Text("Is this about billing, invoices or refunds?"), Yes: typesafe.Text("payments or invoices")}).
//		Choice("Tone", typesafe.Choice{Instructions: typesafe.Text("What is the tone?"), Options: typesafe.Options{{Label: "calm", Description: typesafe.Text("neutral or polite")}, {Label: "angry"}}}).
//		Score("Urgency", typesafe.Score{Instructions: typesafe.Text("How urgent?"), Levels: []typesafe.Content{typesafe.Text("can wait"), typesafe.Text("this week"), typesafe.Text("today")}}).

//		Prepare()
//
// # Tag grammar
//
// The tag is a list of entries separated by ";". An entry is a key, "=" and
// a value, or the bare key optional. The keys are:
//
//   - kind (required): noul, choice or score; it must agree with the field's
//     type (kind=noul for a NoulAnswer field, and so on).
//   - name: the name the question is asked under and its answer comes back
//     under. Without it the name is the field's name as written, Billing for
//     the field Billing: nothing is lowercased or converted, as encoding/json
//     does with an untagged field. The names type, model, usage and answers
//     are reserved.
//   - instructions: the question's instructions, for every kind.
//   - yes, no: what counts as a yes and as a no answer (kind=noul only), the
//     [Noul] members of the same names.
//   - options: the options of a choice (kind=choice only, and required
//     there), separated by "|", in order. An option is a label, or a label,
//     "=" and its description: options=calm=neutral or polite|angry. Labels
//     must be unique.
//   - levels: the levels of a score (kind=score only, and required there),
//     separated by "|", lowest first. Levels must be unique.
//   - optional: the answer may be absent from a response. It changes
//     nothing on the wire; it tells the typed decoder to leave the field's
//     Present false instead of failing when the answer is missing.
//
// Every value is text, sent as [Text] content; JSON content is written with
// [Questions] instead. A value may contain any character, but four must be
// escaped where they would otherwise end something: "\;" is a ";", "\|" a
// "|", "\=" a "=" and "\\" a backslash. A ";" always ends the entry, so it is
// escaped in every value. A "|" ends an option or a level, so it is escaped
// in every option and level, descriptions included:
// options=calm=neutral|polite|angry asks three options, calm, polite and
// angry, where options=calm=neutral\|polite|angry asks two. The first "=" of
// an option ends its label, and a later "=" belongs to the description. In
// instructions, name, yes and no, "|" and "=" stand for themselves, and in a
// level "=" does; escaping them there is allowed but not needed. No other
// escape exists, keys are never escaped, and no space is trimmed.
//
// These are errors: an unknown key, a key given twice, a key the kind does
// not take (yes and no belong to noul, options to choice, levels to score),
// an empty value, an empty entry (";;", or a ";" at either end), an empty
// option, level, label or description, a backslash before any other
// character, a backslash at the end of the tag, and a tag that is not valid
// UTF-8.
//
// A struct tag is itself a Go string literal, so in source each of these
// backslashes is written twice: `typesafe:"kind=noul;instructions=a\\;b"`
// asks "a;b". A single backslash makes the tag malformed (go vet reports it),
// and PreparedFor refuses the field instead of ignoring the tag, as it does
// when the key is written with a space around its colon, is given twice, or
// follows a malformed pair: every tag that reflect would read as having no
// typesafe key, or only the first of two, while it names one.
//
// # Rejections
//
// PreparedFor fails with a [*ConfigError] that names T, the field and the
// rule when:
//
//   - two fields ask under the same name;
//   - a choice has no options, or lists an option label twice (a choice built
//     with [Questions] may have none: its empty criteria are sent for the
//     server to judge);
//   - a score lists a level twice;
//   - a score has no levels;
//   - an answer field's tag has no kind, or the field has no tag at all;
//   - the kind is not noul, choice or score;
//   - the kind does not agree with the field's type, or a field that is not
//     an answer field has a typesafe tag;
//   - a field is a pointer to an answer type (write optional instead);
//   - an unexported field has a typesafe tag;
//   - a struct-typed field, embedded or named, value or pointer, holds a
//     field with a typesafe tag at any depth: the fields of a nested struct
//     are not read, and an embedded struct's are not promoted;
//   - T is not a struct type (a pointer to a struct included);
//   - a question name is reserved;
//   - optional is given on a field that is not an answer field;
//   - the tag does not follow the grammar above;
//   - T has no answer fields: "At least one question is required.", as
//     [Questions.Prepare] reports for an empty set.
//
// Fields that are neither answer fields nor tagged, and unexported fields
// without a typesafe tag, are ignored. Fields of an embedded struct are not
// promoted, and those of a named struct-typed field are not read: only T's
// own fields are, so a struct-typed field whose type holds typesafe tags is
// refused rather than silently skipped, and one without such tags is
// ignored like any other untagged field. A type alias of
// an answer type is that answer type; a type defined from one is not an
// answer type.
//
// # Caching
//
// T is inspected once: the first call builds the set, or the error, and every
// later call for the same T returns that same *Prepared, or that same error,
// for the life of the process, without allocating. The set is read-only and
// safe for concurrent use, like every prepared set; concurrent first calls
