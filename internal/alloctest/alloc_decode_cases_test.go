// The decode cases of AC-P2 and AC-P8, built with and without -race: the
// budgets are TestAllocDecodeFixtures and TestLinearityFlood
// (//go:build !race); TestLinearityFloodTime, AC-P8's time ratio, runs in
// every build, and TestAllocDecodeFixturesFunctional is AC-P2's functional
// half.

// decodeAllocs pins, per fixture, the allocations of one decode of a System
// One body into its answers (want), measured identically on (M) and (L)
// (ledger rows W2.0-01 and W2.0-04), next to AC-P2's frozen budget (frozen:
// docs/perf/frozen-budgets.md, S-D1 variant a1; duplicates at 17 by the
// owner's G2 c). The counts are pinned exactly, not as ceilings (ruling
// R70), so that a sonic upgrade or a decoder change that moves one fails
// here and is looked at, as the NF1 encode pins do. The six fixtures one
// below their budget (duplicates, escaped-member-names, structured-legend,
// deviation-lone-surrogate and the two floods: each holds a structured
// level) are those whose frozen count included the arena that copied
// structured levels, which interning makes unnecessary. The plain
// 3-answer fixture also keeps the plan's ceiling of 8 (NF2).
//
// The keys are exactly the fixtures of testdata that decode as a System One
// body: TestAllocDecodeFixtures decodes every testdata/*.json and fails on
// one that decodes without a pin, or is pinned and does not decode.

// divided by the decodes it holds, the minimum over the flood's spans,
