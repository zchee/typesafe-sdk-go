// encodeExceptions are the single-size cases of AC-P1 outside its
// steady-state budget, by GOARCH (ruling R62: a sonic count that differs by
// architecture is keyed by it). The budget holds "while the scratch stays
// within the 8 MiB ceiling" (frozen-budgets.md AC-P1): sonic grows the
// scratch of a *struct or map state in runtime.growslice steps, and on arm64
// the steps of the 6 MiB *struct state end at 8.86 MiB, past the ceiling,
// so the pool drops the scratch after every call and no call is warm (R22,
// G2 (b); K24 is W5.3's). Where the steps end depends on the exact length
// of the body at each step: the flat map that S-E1 encoded alone ended at
// 8.76 MiB (finding 5), and the same map inside a request body, after
// {"state":, ends at 7.51 MiB and is warm. Such a case is recorded, and its
// scratch must still outgrow the ceiling, so that a change that ends the
// overshoot fails here and the exception is removed; any other case whose
// scratch outgrows the ceiling fails AC-P1.

// A nested map is encoded in the map's random order, and sonic's reserve

// TestAllocEncode checks AC-P1's single-size clauses (NF1) for every state
// kind at 1 KiB, 64 KiB, 1 MiB and 6 MiB: one request body encoded around a
// prepared question set and released on a warm pool allocates at most
// E_sonic + B times, where E_sonic is the state's own encode (the SDK's
// appendState into a buffer that needs no growth, measured in the same run)
// and B = 1 when the caller's argument is boxed at the call; E_sonic is
// pinned to the frozen E(kind) (1, 0 for RawJSON, 1 + m for a state with m
// maps) and the body to exactly E(kind) + B, so a sonic upgrade or an
// encoder change that moves either fails here. Its bytes above E_sonic's
// are exactly the boxing's, 16 B for a bare string, 24 B for a bare RawJSON
// and 0 otherwise: no case varies from run to run, on any host or CI image,
// so the pin is exact, inside the frozen 112 B (also checked, as is the
// plan's 1.05 × body + 4 KiB),
// and the scratch the call leaves is within the 8 MiB ceiling, so the pool
// keeps it. Opening readers is the transport's cost and is not part of it
// (AC-P6 counts it).
//
// Each case starts from empty pools (two collections), as a process that
// sends only states of that size does, since a scratch another case grew
// would hide sonic's overshoot; unmeasured calls then bring it to its steady
// state, where the scratch a call leaves is the one the call before left.
// Counts are runtime.ReadMemStats deltas, the minimum that three of five
// runs share, with the collector off and GOMAXPROCS 1 (section 6.1.6). The
// ENCODE lines are the ledger's rows. The 1 KiB rows are the pins of the
// former TestAllocBodyKinds (W1.2): a bare string 2, a boxed string 1, a
// bare RawJSON 1, a boxed RawJSON 0, a *struct 1 and a flat map 2. The
// cases of encodeExceptions are recorded, the minimum and the maximum of
// five runs.
//
// The file is built without -race: under the race detector sync.Pool.Put
// drops one value in four, so a warm pool is not warm. The functional half,
// the bytes of each body, is TestAllocEncodeFunctional.
