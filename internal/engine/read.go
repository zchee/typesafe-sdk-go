//   - A declared length above limit is refused before anything is read.
//   - The first buffer holds min(declared, initialDeclared) bytes for a
//     declared body and initialUndeclared for an undeclared one.
//   - A full buffer grows by doubling, up to the end the body may reach: its
//     declared length while it is within it, else the limit. Growth that
//     would pass half that end goes to the end at once.
//   - The buffer that can reach the end has one byte of room beyond it, so
//     the read that finds the end of the body, or the byte after the limit,
//     needs no other buffer; the buffers before it are exact powers of two,
//     so none costs the allocator a page for one byte.
//   - The read stops at limit + 1 bytes: that byte makes the body too large.
//
// It returns errTooLarge for a body over the limit, and a read's own error
// other than io.EOF as it is.
