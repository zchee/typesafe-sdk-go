// RawJSON is one JSON value that is already encoded. The SDK never decodes
// it: strings keep their escape sequences and numbers their spelling. That
// makes it the way to send a number spelled exactly: a float in a state that
// is not RawJSON is written as Go's JSON encoders spell it, 3 for 3.0 and
// 10000000000000000 for 1e16, where the Python SDK writes 3.0 and 1e+16.
//
// As a [RawQuestion] field value it is checked and written without its
// insignificant whitespace, as the value it holds; [JSON] takes one to build
// structured [Content]. As the state of a call, or as the value of a member
// the call adds to the request body, it is sent as it is, whitespace
// included, after a check of its first byte only: a state must start a
// string, an array or an object, a member any JSON value. That it is one
// valid JSON value is then the caller's contract. A *RawJSON there is sent
// as the RawJSON it points to; a nil one is refused. Nested inside a state
// or a member's value (a map value, a struct field, a slice element, through
// a pointer too), it is written by [RawJSON.MarshalJSON]: checked and written
// without its insignificant whitespace, as a question field is. A member name
// repeated inside an object (`{"a":1,"a":2}`) is passed through unchanged,
// which a Python dict cannot produce; the server decides which one counts.

// request body member is sent as the JSON it holds, never as a base64
// string. It fails when r is not exactly one valid JSON value, checked by the
// same scanner as a question's JSON, so that invalid JSON never reaches the
// network (ruling R60); the encoder checks the result a second time.
