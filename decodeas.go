// Ask asks the questions the struct type T declares about state and returns
// the answers as a T: it is [Client.SystemOne] with the question set
// [PreparedFor] builds for T, followed by [DecodeAs] of the response.
//
//	t, err := typesafe.Ask[Ticket](ctx, c, state)
//
// A T that PreparedFor refuses fails with its [*ConfigError] before any
// request is made. Every error of the call itself, an [*APIError], a
// [*ConnectionError], a [*TimeoutError], a [*ResponseValidationError] of the
// response as a whole and the others [Client.SystemOne] lists, is returned
// as SystemOne returns it. A response whose answers do not fit T fails as
// DecodeAs says, with the call's endpoint in the error and its header
// redacted as the call's other errors redact theirs: by the header's name,
// and a header whose value holds the client's API key.
//
// Ask returns only the answers. A caller that also needs the response,
// its request id, usage, model or raw body, makes the two calls Ask makes:
//
//	qs, err := typesafe.PreparedFor[Ticket]()
//	resp, err := c.SystemOne(ctx, state, qs)
//	t, err := typesafe.DecodeAs[Ticket](resp)
//	id, ok := resp.Meta().RequestID()

// DecodeAs returns the answers of resp as a T, the struct type whose fields
// declare the questions ([PreparedFor] has the grammar): each answer field
// holds the answer that resp carries under the field's question name.
// resp may answer a question set built by hand, such as one from
// [NewQuestions]; the names are what DecodeAs matches, so a field tagged
// name=spam reads the answer to the question "spam".
//
// DecodeAs reads the answers as [SystemOneResponse.Answers] holds them:
// when the body repeats a name, the last answer under it is the one read,
// and an answer of a type this version does not model is not there. The
// fields hold copies that share resp's slices and bytes, which must not be
// modified; resp itself is not changed, and must not be nil. Answers that
// no field of T names are ignored. Each field read has Present true; an
// optional field without an answer is left as the zero answer, whose
// Present is false and which marshals as null, as the Python SDK holds and
// dumps None there.
//
// A T that PreparedFor refuses fails with its [*ConfigError]. Otherwise the
// fields are read in their order in T, and the first that does not fit
// fails the whole decode: DecodeAs returns the zero T, never one holding
// the fields read before the failure, and a [*ResponseValidationError]
// whose FieldPath names the answer. T's fields are the answers lifted out
// of the response's "answers" member, so the paths are the ones the Python
// SDK reports for such a response model, a SystemOneResponse subclass with
// one field per answer (the upstream tests' TypedSystemOneResponse): the
// answer's name, then the member and the key. An answer of a type this
// version does not model has been skipped, as that model skips it, so under
// a required field's name it fails as absent and under an optional field's
// name it leaves the field absent, and a response without an "answers"
// member fails at T's first required field:
//
//	the answer is absent and the field is not optional  <name>
//	the answer is of another kind than the field        <name>.type
//	a choice picks an option T does not list            <name>.choice
//	a choice gives a probability to such an option      <name>.probabilities.<option>
//	a score's legend has a level beyond T's levels      <name>.legend.<level>
//	a score gives a probability to such a level         <name>.probabilities.<level>
//
// A failure of the response as a whole, a missing model or usage or an
// answer without a type, comes from the decoder before T is filled, at the
// decoder's own path, such as usage or answers.spam.noul, as in Python,
// which validates the base model's fields first.
//
// A choice's options and a score's levels are the ones T's tag lists: a
// level counts from zero, so a score with three levels has the levels 0, 1
// and 2, and a level is written in decimal in the path. An option or a
// level the answer does not mention, and the score's value, are not
// checked. Python checks an option only when the response model's own type
// says so, with a Literal, and then reports the pick at "tone.choice", as
// DecodeAs does.
//
// The error carries resp's HTTP metadata: its status, header, request id
// and body when resp came from a request, and none of them when it was read
// back with [SystemOneResponse.UnmarshalJSON], whose Meta is empty. Its
// Header is a new map in which each value of a header that is a credential
// by its name, such as Authorization, Cookie or Set-Cookie
// ([APIError.Header] lists them), is "***"; the other headers' values are
// the response's own and must not be modified. DecodeAs has no client, so
// unlike [Ask] it cannot look for the client's API key: a key the server
// echoes in another header or in the request id stays visible in Header
// and Error, where Ask shows "***". Neither redacts FieldPath: the answer's
// name and the option or level it names are shown as they arrived, as the
// SDK's other errors show a path (ruling R103-rev). Its Endpoint is empty;
// Ask fills it in.
